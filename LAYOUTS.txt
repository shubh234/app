                LAYOUTS-vidhi
*******SHORT DESCRIPTION-
A layout defines the visual structure for a user interface, such as the UI for an activity or app widget.
	For example- The activity_main.xml is a layout file available in res/layout directory,that is referenced by your application when building its interface.


*******LONG DESCRIPTION-
	An Android layout is a class that handles arranging the way its children appear on the screen. 
 	Anything that is a View (or inherits from View) can be a child of a layout. All of the layouts inherit from ViewGroup (which inherits from View) so you can nest layouts. 
	 You could also create your own custom layout by making a class that inherits from ViewGroup.

-->The default layout is-

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context="com.example.vidhi.proj.MainActivity">

    <TextView
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Hello World!"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"app:layout_constraintLeft_toLeftOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintRight_toRightOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />
