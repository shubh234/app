->Broadcast Receivers simply respond to broadcast messages from other applications or from the system itself. 
->These messages are sometime called events or intents. For example, applications can register for the ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED system event which is fired once the Android system has completed the boot process.

1)Creating the Broadcast Receiver.
2)Registering Broadcast Receiver.
